Array-Tour version 0.03
=======================

Array::Tour is a module that returns cell coordinates to allow an application
to visit cells in a specialized order.  Currently there are four of these
modules bundled in the package; Array::Tour itself, Array::Tour::Spiral,
Array::Tour::Serpentine, Array::Tour::RandomWalk.

THESE MODULES ARE STILL EXPERIMENTAL.

SOME CLASS METHODS MAY CHANGE, ALTHOUGH THE CONSTANTS PROBABLY WILL NOT.
