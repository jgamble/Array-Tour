Revision history for Perl extension Array::Tour.

0.01  Wed Mar 22 15:21:37 2006
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-A -X -v 0.1 -n Array::Tour
	- Refactored code to make Spiral.pm and Serpentine.pm
	  child classes of Array::Tour.
	- Added packages Spiral.pm and Serpentine.pm.

0.02  Thurs Mar 28 2008
	- Added methods _make_array() for creating an
	  internal array for bookkeepping purposes (will be
	  useful for a not-yet written module).
	- Added get_array() to retrieve that internal array for
	  the users.
	- Added method uses_array() so that user can know whether
	  the Array::Tour::XXXX module has an internal array to
	  return, or whether the package works by touring only.
	- Changed pod style to comment individual methods.

0.03  Thurs Jul 31 2008
	- Added RandomWalk.pm.  It's suspicously like the "make"
	  code in Games::Maze.  I'm sure it's just a coincidence.
	  Plan to add Prim's and Kruskal's later.
	- Method adjusted_position(), added to Tour.pm, will
	  automatically add the {offset} co-ordinates to the
	  {position} co-ordinates.  Used by base and child classes
	  in the next() method.

0.04  Sat Aug 02 2008
	- First upload to CPAN failed to include helper.pl and
	  all the tests failed.  Added helper.pl to the MANIFEST.
